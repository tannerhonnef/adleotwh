        "Some strategies used in achieving the goal of using a CNN to capture local detail and a transformed to catch longer range dependencies are overlapping sliding window testing, testing time augmentation, and post processing methods which remove small objects and small holes.  The global and local interaction module allows for the best characteristics from each branch to be captured and concatendated into the output which is named CT3/CT4 in this case (figure 9).  This block allows the CNN to be fused with global information and the transformed to be fused with local information where they can be concatenated and the best parts of each can be kept.  "

The attention module takes in features from both CNN and Transformer. We know that the query, key, and value are the three components of the basic self-attention module. When the query branch receives input from Transformer, and the key and value branches receive input from CNN, the global context in the Transformer branch helps to reweight the local information of the CNN (global to local). Similarly, when the query branch receives input from CNN, and the key and value branches receive input from Transformer, the local features of the CNN help to reweight the global features of the Transformer (local to global). Concatenating these two results produces an interactive fusion of global and local information.\n",

        "One of the reasons RNNs are able to handle sequential input with varying length is because of the design with a hidden state which maintains a memory of the previous inputs and can update accordingly.  Another reason why RNNs can handle sequential input of varying length is because the number of model parameters will remain constant as the number of time steps increases.  This helps to cut down on the run time of the model because there is not an increase in the number of parameters."
